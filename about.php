                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Founded in 2005, Madina FC started as a small group of football enthusiasts who wanted to bring competitive football to our community. What began as a weekend pastime quickly grew into a serious football club with multiple teams across different age groups.</p>
                <p>Over the years, we've won several local and regional championships, but more importantly, we've fostered a sense of community and sportsmanship that extends beyond the pitch.</p>
